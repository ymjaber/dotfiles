# Configurations notes

These configurations are for personal use and especially **Hyprland** is configured for my PC, the way I manage my work and swap between docs and code.

Feel free to use them as inspiration or copy them, but keep in mind that they may not work perfectly on your setup without adjustments.

Note that its still under development and I will heavily modify them in the next weeks.
